ZooKeeper is an open-source coordination service that plays a crucial role in the functioning and management of Apache Kafka, a distributed streaming platform. Kafka relies on ZooKeeper to maintain its metadata, manage distributed brokers, and ensure the overall stability and consistency of the Kafka cluster.

Here are some key roles that ZooKeeper plays in Kafka:

    Cluster Management: ZooKeeper helps Kafka manage the broker nodes in a Kafka cluster. It keeps track of which brokers are currently online and available, their metadata (such as topic and partition information), and the leader/follower status of partitions. This information is essential for the Kafka brokers to know how to route and replicate messages.

    Leader Election: Kafka uses ZooKeeper to perform leader elections for partitions. Each partition has one leader and multiple followers, and ZooKeeper helps coordinate the selection of leaders. When a leader fails, ZooKeeper helps in choosing a new leader for that partition.

    Topic and Partition Management: Kafka topics and partitions are registered and managed through ZooKeeper. This includes information about how many partitions a topic has and which brokers are responsible for each partition.

    Broker Registration: Kafka brokers register themselves with ZooKeeper when they start up and deregister when they shut down or experience issues. This information helps in dynamically adjusting the cluster's state.

    Configuration Management: Kafka cluster configuration parameters and settings can also be stored and managed through ZooKeeper. This allows for the dynamic reconfiguration of Kafka brokers without requiring a cluster restart.

    Fault Tolerance: ZooKeeper itself is designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant. It uses a quorum-based approach, typically requiring a majority of ZooKeeper nodes to be available to ensure cluster stability. This design aligns well with Kafka's goal of being a robust and fault-tolerant distributed system.

It's important to note that Kafka has been working on reducing its dependency on ZooKeeper in recent versions, with the aim of eventually eliminating it altogether. This effort is part of the KIP (Kafka Improvement Proposal) process and is driven by the desire to simplify Kafka's architecture and improve its performance. However, as of my last knowledge update in September 2021, ZooKeeper is still an integral part of Kafka for many deployments.
